## Easy-to-Use Deep Learning Library
All neural networks are created and implemented from scratch using solely NumPy and Python modules. This library is created for my own educational growth, and I hope to make it usable for the rest of the DL noobs out there. Wish me luck on this creative endeavor.

### Why "DunnLen?"
"Dunn" is the first syllable of my surname, which has Scottish origins. As for the "len" part, try saying "learn" in a heavy British accent.
